# JS Countdown (practice project).

Small JS app to get 'days', 'hours', 'minutes' and 'seconds' remaining to a certain date.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone the repository and open it with live server (VSCode extension). Easy as that!

## Help

* If you want to change the target date, you have to modify the following line in the script.js file:

`
const countdownTarget = '1 Jan 2022';
`
